**Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform with Refundable Investments**

Overview
The Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform is a blockchain-based application designed to revolutionize the crowdfunding ecosystem by providing transparent, milestone-based funding with a built-in refund mechanism. This platform ensures that project creators only receive funds as they meet pre-defined project milestones, and investors are refunded a portion of their contributions if milestones are missed. By leveraging the power of decentralized finance (DeFi), privacy-preserving technology, and stablecoin transactions, the platform ensures a secure, trustworthy, and transparent crowdfunding experience.

Key Features
Milestone-Based Fund Release:

Projects receive funding progressively as they meet specific, validated milestones.
If milestones are not met within the set deadlines, a portion of the funds is automatically refunded to the investors.
Refundable Investments:

Investors are protected by smart contracts that automatically issue refunds if project milestones are not achieved.
Privacy-Preserving Investments:

Investor data is protected using Calimero's privacy layer, ensuring personal and financial information remains confidential while participating in decentralized crowdfunding.
Stablecoin Investments with PYUSD:

The platform uses PYUSD, a stablecoin, to enable secure, low-cost investments and transfers, avoiding the volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies.
Smart Contract Automation:

Fund management and milestone-based fund releases are executed through smart contracts on the NEAR Protocol, ensuring transparency, immutability, and security.
QuickNode Functions power the backend smart contract execution, ensuring efficient and cost-effective contract management.
Tech Stack
Blockchain: NEAR Protocol for decentralized finance and smart contract management.
Stablecoin: PYUSD for stable and low-cost investments.
Data Privacy: Calimero for privacy-preserving technology, ensuring investors' sensitive information is secure.
Oracles: Chainlink (or similar) oracles for verifying milestone completion and triggering fund releases or refunds.

How It Works
Investor Participation:

Investors select a project from the list of available crowdfunding campaigns.
They contribute funds using PYUSD, which is locked in a smart contract.
Milestone-Based Fund Release:

The project owner sets milestones that outline project goals and deliverables.
As milestones are achieved and verified by oracles, a portion of the funds is released to the project owner.
Refundable Investments:

If a project fails to meet its milestones within the set deadlines, a portion of the invested funds is automatically refunded to investors based on the missed milestones.
Privacy Protection:

Investor information is encrypted and processed through Calimero to ensure privacy, making it visible only to authorized entities.
